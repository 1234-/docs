# Scoped Packages

Scopes are like namespaces for npm modules. Each npm user has their own scope.

```
@username/project-name
```

## Update npm and login

You need a version of npm greater than `2.7.0`. Run `sudo npm install -g npm` to update npm.

You also need to log in again on the command line if this is your first time using scoped modules. Run `npm login`.

## Initializing a scoped package

To create a scoped package, you simply use a package name that starts with your scope.

```json
{
  "name": "@username/project-name"
}
```

If you use `npm init`, you can add your scope as an option to that command.

```
$ npm init --scope=username
```

If you use the same scope all the time, you will probably want to set this option in your `~/.npmrc` file.

```
$ npm config set scope username
```

## Using a scoped package

To use a scoped package, you simply include the scope wherever you use the package name.

In package.json:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@username/project-name": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

On the command line:

```sh
$ npm install @username/project-name --save
```

In a `require` statement:

```js
var project-name = require("@username/project-name")
```
