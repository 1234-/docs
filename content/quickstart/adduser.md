# Creating your user

In this step you will create a user with the npm registry. This gives you the ability to publish to the registry.

```sh
$ npm adduser
Username: your_user
Password:
Email: (this IS public) your_user@gmail.com
```

<div class="test">
Test: You should now have a page on npm. Go to npmjs.com/~<your_user>.
</div>

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-default" href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#js-report-problem-modal">
Report a problem
</a>
<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary js-button js-complete">

</a>
